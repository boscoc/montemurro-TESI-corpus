This repository includes two files in csv in which are available the data used for the experimental part of the master's degree thesis of Teresa Montemurro. The data are samples extracted from the study presented in Cignarella et al, 2021 (https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3033/paper15.pdf)

In the file Montemurro_campione_1000_avvocato_anonimizzato.csv you can find a set of 1,000 tweets, in anonymized form, in which the term 'avvocato' occurs, annotated with the label 'maschile' (if the term refers to a man) or 'femminile' (if the term refers to a woman).

In the file dataset_Montemurro_200x5_anonimizzato.csv you can find 5 sets of 200 tweets each, in anonymized form and annotated in the same format of the other file; in each set one of the following terms occurs: 'sindaco', 'rettore', 'ministro', 'ingegnere', 'avvocato'.
